abstract="Many applications of congruence closure nowadays require the ability of recovering, among the thousands of input equations, the small subset that caused the equivalence of a given pair of terms. For this purpose, here we introduce an incremental congruence closure algorithm that has an additional {\$}{\backslash}mathit{\{}Explain{\}}{\$}operation.",
