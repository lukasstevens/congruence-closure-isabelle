Interactive theorem provers are useful for the formalization and proving of formulas. Congruence closure is already used by most theorem provers for solving decision procedures. However, the implementations of congruence closure are usually not formally proven for completeness.

This thesis describes the implementation and the termination and correctness proofs  of an explain operation for union-find and of a congruence closure algorithm, whose implementation is partly based on the union-find algorithm. It also contains an implementation of the explain operation for congruence closure with a termination proof. The proofs are formalized in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. The implementation is based on the paper by Nieuwenhuis and Oliveras \cite{Nieuwenhuis} and on the formalization of the union-find data structure in Isabelle/HOL by Lammich \cite{unionfind-isabelle}. The implementation can be used in the future in order to develop an automatic proof strategy in Isabelle.
