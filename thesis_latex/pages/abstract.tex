This thesis describes a formal implementation and verification of a congruence closure algorithm in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. Congruence closure is used by theorem provers for solving decision procedures.
In these settings, an \emph{explain} operation is useful

The algorithm in this thesis is based on the union-find algorithm, as described by Nieuwenhuis and Oliveras in \cite{Nieuwenhuis}.
First, an \emph{explain} operation for union-find is implemented with proofs for correctness and termination. It extends the formalization of the union-find data structure in Isabelle/HOL by Lammich \cite{unionfind-isabelle}.
Then, the congruence closure algorithm is implemented and verified for correctness and termination.
Lastly, an implementation of the \emph{explain} operation for congruence closure with a termination proof is presented.
The implementation can be used in the future in order to develop an automated proof strategy in Isabelle/HOL which can solve congruence closure problems.
