Congruence Closure is already used by most theorem provers for solving decision procedures.  However, the implementations of congruence closure are usually not formally proven for completeness.

This thesis describes the implementation and correctness proofs for a union-find algorithm with an explain operation and congruence closure with an explain operation, which is partly based on the implementation of the union-find algorithm. The proofs are formalized in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. The correctness proof for the explain operation is only described, not formally proven yet. The implementation is based on the paper by Nieuwenhuis and Oliveras \cite{Nieuwenhuis}. This result can be used in order to develop an automatic proof strategy in Isabelle, for automatic proofs of theorems.
