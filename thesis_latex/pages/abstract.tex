Congruence closure is already used by most theorem provers for solving decision procedures.  However, the implementations of congruence closure are usually not formally proven for completeness.

This thesis describes the implementation and correctness proofs for two algorithms: a union-find algorithm with an explain operation and congruence closure with an explain operation, whose implementation is partly based on the union-find algorithm. The proofs are formalized in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. The correctness proof for the congruence closure explain operation is only described, not formally proven yet. The implementation is based on the paper by Nieuwenhuis and Oliveras \cite{Nieuwenhuis}. The implementation can be used in order to develop an automatic proof strategy in Isabelle, for automatic proofs of theorems.
