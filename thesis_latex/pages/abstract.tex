Congruence closure is a key algorithm of decision procedures in automated theorem proving. In these settings, it is important to have trustworthy implementations, that are formally proven for correctness.
This thesis describes a formal implementation and verification of a congruence closure algorithm in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL.
The implementation is based on the union-find algorithm.
In the context of decision procedures, it is necessary to also compute a certificate which proves that two given terms are congruent.
This is done by the \emph{explain} operation.
The algorithms in this thesis are based on the description of Nieuwenhuis and Oliveras \cite{Nieuwenhuis}.

First, an \emph{explain} operation for union-find is implemented with proofs for correctness and termination. It extends the formalization of the union-find data structure in Isabelle/HOL by Lammich \cite{unionfind-isabelle}.
Then, the congruence closure algorithm is implemented and verified for correctness and termination.
Lastly, an implementation of the \emph{cc\_explain} operation for congruence closure with a termination proof is presented.
The correctness proof of \emph{cc\_explain} is not part of this thesis.
