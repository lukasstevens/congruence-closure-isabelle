%TODO: Acknowledgments
First of all, I want to thank Prof. Tobias Nipkow for introducing me to Isabelle through the course ``Semantics''.
I am also extremely grateful to my supervisor Lukas Stevens for answering all the questions I had about Isabelle and for his valuable comments and feedback.

Moreover, I am deeply obliged to my family, particularly to my parents, for proofreading this thesis and for their constant love and support.
Special thanks to Manon and Tony, for being the best friends I could ask for, and to Timm, Sabrina and Jakob, for proofreading the thesis and for all the time we spent together in the last months.
