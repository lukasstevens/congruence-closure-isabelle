First of all, I want to thank Manon and Tony for being great friends.
Moreover, I am thankful to my parents for proof-reading this thesis and for their constant love and support, and to my little sister Esther for being cute.
Lastly, I want to thank my supervisor Lukas Stevens for answering all my questions.
