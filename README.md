# Proof-Producing Congruence Closure in Isabelle/HOL


## Description

Formalization and formal correctness proofs of the algorithms presented in the paper "Proof-Producing Congruence Closure" by Robert Nieuwenhuis and Albert Oliveras. It includes the *explain* operation for union-find, the congruence closure algorithm and the *explain* operation for congruence closure.

All formalizations and proofs are defined in the generic proof assistant [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).
